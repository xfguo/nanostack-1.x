libSSI v0.9.4 README
-----------------

1. Overview

The SSI protocol helper library.

2. Structure

See the Doxygen documentation.

3. Usage

SSI-Browser will be modified to use this library.

4. Bugs

	-Some of the parsing helper functions should check the packet type.
	-The SSI specification (ch. 3.1) defines two different types of the essentially
	 same SSI packets. If the type byte contains a lower case character a two byte
	 CRC field is appended to the packet. At the moment the SSI library in the 
	 Sensinode nanostack does _not_ include the CRC in any packet. Thus the libSSI
	 functions are at the moment incompatible with such SSI packets that contain
	 the CRC. Namely the problems are:
	 i)	none of the packet creation functions add the CRC and
	 ii)
