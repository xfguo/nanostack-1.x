 *
 *	An array constructed from this structure is used to store the connection information table i.e. the table which the nRouted checks 
 *	where to relay data coming from the GW dongle. One nRd_conn_table_t structure contains the relevant information for one TCP connection.
 *	The different fields (proto, sadd etc.) are filled in by the process_tcp_connection() function as the application that initiated the TCP
 *	connection sends the necessary information. The format of the packet containing this information is defined in the nanostack-PC manual.
 *	The connection is not active (i.e. no data is relayed to the application) before the application has sent this information. The fields
 *	act as a filters which the nRouted uses to decide where (one or several) to relay a packet after it has been received from the GW dongle.
 *	Not all the fields are mandatory meaning that a) not all the fields are applicable to all possible protocols (e.g. for nanoUDP only port
 *	number is used. See the nanoDUP spcification for more information) and b) limited wildcard functionality is available. See the 
 *	nanoStack-PC manual for more details. More complex filters would be possible to implement (e.g. accepting only packets which contain
 *	signal level information) but usefullness of such extensions is highly questionable.
