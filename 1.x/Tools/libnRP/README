nPing v0.9 README
-----------------

1. Overview

	The libnRP is intended to help a user to write his/hers own program that
	uses a nRouted server to connect to sensor nodes. It has several
	definitions, macros, functions etc. that can be very helpful.
	Probably the most useful thing is the libnrp_create_data_pkt_hdr()
	function that contrary to what its name might suggest can be used to
	create a complete nRP data packet.

2. Structure

	To be added later.

3. Usage

	At the moment there is one usage example available. The nPing (from
	v0.9) uses the libnRP and can be used as a source of information how
	to use the libnRP (including a makefile). There will be a doxygen
	generated html reference available soon.

4. Bugs

	Both libnrp_create_data_pkt_hdr() and ilbnrp_create_conf_pkt() have
	some bugs, a fix will be available soon.
