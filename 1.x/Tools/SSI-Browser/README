SSI-Browser README v0.9
-----------------------

1.	Overview

	The SSI-Browser v0.8 is a simple command line browser that implements the most essential subset of the SSI protocol.
	The supported functions are sensor discovery and sensor data request. See more details from the SSI protocol
	specification. The SSI (Simple Sensor Interface) protocol is an extremely simplified but yet versatile protocol
	to fetch information from sensor nodes. The information can be general information about the configuration of
	the node and specific information about the sensor data that is available.

2.	Structure

	The SSI-Browser has only slightly more complicated structure when compared to the one of nPing. These differences are
	mostly due to the SSI protocol. All the preliminary steps before the actual actions can be started are almost identical
	to the of nPing. When the nPing application would start sending the ping packets the SSI-Browser sends 1) a sensor
	discovery packet and 2) sensor data request packet.
	
3.	Usage

	Usage information is available by typing ./SSI-Browser --help.

4.	Notes

	The SSI-Browser will be modified to use the libSSI quite soon.

5.	Bugs

	Probably several, but none that I'm aware of.
