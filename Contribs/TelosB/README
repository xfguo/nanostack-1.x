TelosB Contribution

Tomi Pitkaaho (Cenria)
Zach Shelby (Sensinode)

Basic platform port and example for TelosB compatible platforms. Main testing platform has been the Maxfor 810CM device.

This port is based on the Sensinode Micro platform (/Platform/micro) which has the same chips as in TelosB. However the radio is connected in a different way.

The is still under development, the radio driver needs updating for the TelosB connection of the CC2420.

Tested on NanoStack v1.0.2
