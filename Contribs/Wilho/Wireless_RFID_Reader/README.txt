This package contains the deliverables of the ISG-Wilho project. The research was conducted at the University of Oulu, by the Intelligent Systems Group (ISG) and the Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC). The project was funded by the Finnish Funding Agency of Technology and Innovation, Nokia, ODL Health, Oulu University Hospital, Sensinode, and Medanets. The project time span was from November 2006 to February 2008.

This project focused on short-range wireless communication in hospital environment. The goals of the project were:

(a) to build a mobile terminal that can communicate over a short-range wireless network with the devices in the local environment,

(b) to build a small RFID reader that communicates with the mobile terminal in a wireless fashion,

(c) to create scenarios for potential application that utilize these devices in hospital environment, and

(d) to developed an application for demonstration purposes.

We focused primarily on low-rate medical applications while considering the emerging low-rate wireless personal area network technology as specified in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with implementation of 6LoWPAN. We selected the Nokia 770 as terminal and Near Field Communication compliant RFID technology for the fulfilment of this project.

The main results were:

(1) a wireless RFID reader based on Near Field Communication compliant RFID technology; communicating
with the N770 terminal using IEEE 802.15.4 wireless link and the 6LoWPANprotocol.

(2) Casing adding IEEE 802.15.4 wireless transceiver using the 6LoWPAN protocol to N770.

(3)  Ideasilo software platform and two applications built on top of it. This platform facilitates the development of applications which use RFID and IEEE 802.15.4 technologies to communicate with other devices and RFID tags in the environment.
